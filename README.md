Every year 15% of XYZ company employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent
pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition(employees leaving,
either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons
• The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a
reputation loss among consumers and partners
• A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
• More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize
themselves to the company
Hence, the management wants to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition.
Basically their focus -
• What are changes should be made on the workplace, in order to retain most of the employees
• Which are the key variables which drives attrition, so that it can be addressed right away.
